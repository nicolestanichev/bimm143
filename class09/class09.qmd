## The PDB database 

The main database for structural biology is called the PDB. Let's have a look at what is contains: 

Download a CSV file from the PDB site (accessible from “Analyze” > “PDB Statistics” > “by Experimental Method and Molecular Type”

```{r}
stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
stats
```


```{r}
stats$Total
```

Oh, these characters are not numeric...

```{r}
as.numeric( sub(",", "", stats$Total))
```

```{r stats, message=FALSE}

library(readr)

stats <- read_csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
stats
```

```{r}
n.total <- sum(stats$Total)
n.total
```

```{r}
sum(stats$Neutron)
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy. Give your ansmwer to 2 significant figures. 

```{r}
n.xray <- sum(stats$`X-ray`)
p.xray <- n.xray / n.total * 100
round(p.xray, 2)
```

```{r}
n.em <- sum(stats$`EM`)
p.em <- n.em / n.total * 100
round(p.em, 2)
```


There are `r round(p.xray, 2)` percent Xray structures in the PDB


> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?


```{r}
round( stats$Total[1]/n.total * 100, 2)
```



## Exploring PDB structures

Package for structural bioinformatics
```{r}
library(bio3d)

hiv <- read.pdb("1hsg")
hiv
```

Let's first use the Mol* viewer to explore this structure. 

![My first view of HIV-Pr](1HSG.png)

And a view of the ligand (ball and stick) with catalytic ASP 25 amino-acids (spacefull)





## PDB objects in R

```{r}
head(hiv$atom)
```

Extract the sequence 
```{r}
pdbseq(hiv)
```

```{r}
chainA_seq <- pdbseq(trim.pdb(hiv, chain="A"))
```


I can interactively view these PDB objects in R with the new **bio3dview** package. This is not yet on CRAN

To install this I can setup **pak** package and use it to install **bio3dview** from GitHub. In my console I first run

install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("bioboot/bio3dview")
install.packages("NGLVieweR")



```{r}
library(bio3dview)
library(NGLVieweR)

view.pdb(hiv) |>
  setSpin()
```

Change some settings

```{r}
sel <- atom.select(hiv, resno = 25)

view.pdb(hiv, highlight = sel,
         highlight.style = "spacefill",
         colorScheme="chain", 
         col=c("blue", "orange"),
         backgroundColor= "pink")
```

## Predict protein flexibility

We can run a bioinformatics calculation to predict protein dynamics - i.e. functional motions. 

We will use the `nma()` function:

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

Generate a "trajectory" of predicted motion
```{r}
mktrj(m, file="ADK_nma.pdb")
```

```{r}
view.nma(m)
```
